# Mirror's Edge Catalyst Website Redesign

This was created as a way to practice some web design and development. It pulls news posts from markdown files and creates separate pages for them, and page data is sourced from toml files. 

It was created because the original owners were moving to a more unified corporate website to fit the rest of their brands which makes sense but I wanted to try my hand at trying to keep individuality with the project so I hope you like it.
